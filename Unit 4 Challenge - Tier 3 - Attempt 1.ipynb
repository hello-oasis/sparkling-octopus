    "# Springboard Data Science Career Track Unit 4 Challenge - Tier 3 Complete\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "Hey! Great job getting through those challenging DataCamp courses. You're learning a lot in a short span of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to apply the skills you've been learning, bridging the gap between the controlled environment of DataCamp and the *slightly* messier work that data scientists do with actual datasets!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the mystery we’re going to solve: ***which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London [(here's some info for the curious)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs). Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "***This is the Tier 3 notebook, which means it's not filled in at all: we'll just give you the skeleton of a project, the brief and the data. It's up to you to play around with it and see what you can find out! Good luck! If you struggle, feel free to look at easier tiers for help; but try to dip in and out of them, as the more independent work you do, the better it is for your learning!***\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will make use of only what you learned in the following DataCamp courses: \n",
    "- Prework courses (Introduction to Python for Data Science, Intermediate Python for Data Science)\n",
    "- Data Types for Data Science\n",
    "- Python Data Science Toolbox (Part One) \n",
    "- pandas Foundations\n",
    "- Manipulating DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "- Merging DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the tools, techniques and concepts in the above DataCamp courses, this challenge should require the application of the following: \n",
    "- **pandas**\n",
    "    - **data ingestion and inspection** (pandas Foundations, Module One) \n",
    "    - **exploratory data analysis** (pandas Foundations, Module Two)\n",

    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Import and load the data\n",
    "2. Clean the data: renamed headers, removed dupes, null values, and non-boroughs, added a year column using a Lambda function, grouped by year/borough to calculate the average price per year. \n",
    "4. Model: created a new dictionary and created a function to loop through the boroughs in the dataframes and calcuated the ratio of average prices between 1998 and 2018; the function would return the borough as the key, and the new ratio as the value. Converted the dictionary into a dataframe, then pulled the top 10 highest ratios and plotted them as a bar graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "Based on the annual average prices, I've concluded that Hounslow, Richmond upon Thames, and Harrow have had the greatest increase in average housing prices between 1998 and 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From a real estate investment or development perspective:**\n",
    "While these boroughs have shown growth over the past decade, it would be smart to investigate what drove growth in these areas (transportation, infrastructure, job availability, zoning, etc) to help identify other emerging markets for early investments."
